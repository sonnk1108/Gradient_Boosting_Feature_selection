Gradient Boosting Feature Selection With Machine Learning Classifiers for Intrusion Detection on Power Grids

â€”Smart grids rely on SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems to monitor and control complex electrical networks in order to provide reliable energy to homes and industries. However, the increased inter-connectivity and remote accessibility of SCADA systems expose them to cyber
attacks. As a consequence, developing effective security mechanisms is a priority in order to protect the network from internal and external attacks. We propose an integrated framework for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for smart grids which combines feature engineering-based preprocessing with machine learning
classifiers. Whilst most of the machine learning techniques finetune the hyper-parameters to improve the detection rate, our approach focuses on selecting the most promising features of the dataset using Gradient Boosting Feature Selection (GBFS) before applying the classification algorithm, a combination which
improves not only the detection rate but also the execution speed. GBFS uses the Weighted Feature Importance (WFI) extraction technique to reduce the complexity of classifiers. We implement and evaluate various decision-tree based machine learning techniques after obtaining the most promising features of the
power grid dataset through a GBFS module, and show that this approach optimizes the False Positive Rate (FPR) and the execution time.
